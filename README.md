# IPv6 Router and DHCP Configuration - Read Me

## Introduction
This guide gives you a clear, step-by-step way to set up IPv6 router settings and DHCPv6 servers in a network using Cisco Packet Tracer. You'll work with several routers (named R1, R2, R3, R4) and PCs (like PC1, PC2, PC3, and so on). Each router will serve as a DHCPv6 server for a particular PC network.

## Prerequisites
- You should have Cisco Packet Tracer software installed on your computer.
- You should also have a basic grasp of IPv6 addressing and routing concepts.

## Topology Overview
- R1, R2, R3, and R4 routers are connected via their Gig 0/0/0 interfaces with the network prefix 2001:12:34::/64.
- Each router serves as a DHCPv6 server for a specific PC network.

## Configuration Steps

1. **IPv6 Interface Configuration**
   - Configure the Gig 0/0/0 interface on each router with an IPv6 address using the network prefix 2001:12:34::/64.

2. **Router Partial Configuration**
   - Configure R1, R2, R3, and R4 with partial settings to enable PC1 and PC2 to obtain IPv6 addresses, ping each other, and allow PC1 to ping the Gig 0/0/0 interfaces on R3 and R4.

3. **Enabling IPv6 Routing**
   - Ensure that IPv6 routing is enabled on all routers to allow packets to be routed between different PC networks.

4. **DHCPv6 Server Configuration**
   - Configure each router as a DHCPv6 server for its corresponding PC network. For example, configure R1 to serve PC1 network, R2 for PC2, and so on.
   - Set the DHCPv6 pool with the appropriate IPv6 address range, DNS server information, and other required settings.

5. **PC Configuration**
   - Configure each PC to use DHCPv6 for obtaining IPv6 settings.
   - PC1 should get settings from R1, PC2 from R2, and so on.

6. **Testing Connectivity**
   - Check if PCs in the same network can communicate with each other.
   - Verify if PCs in different networks can establish connectivity.
   - Make sure that PC1 can successfully ping the Gig 0/0/0 interfaces on both R3 and R4.

7. **Additional Configuration**
   - Configure additional settings on routers to allow all PCs to obtain correct IPv6 address settings and ping the Gig 0/0/1 interface on every other router.

## Note
- This guide provides a general outline. Specific commands and configurations may vary based on the Cisco IOS version and software.
- The provided network prefix (2001:12:34::/64) is a placeholder. You can replace it with your actual IPv6 network prefix.
