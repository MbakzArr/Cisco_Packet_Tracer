# IPv6 Router and DHCP Configuration - Read Me

## Introduction
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for configuring IPv6 router settings and DHCPv6 servers for a network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The setup involves multiple routers (R1, R2, R3, R4) and PCs (PC1, PC2, PC3, etc.), where each router acts as a DHCPv6 server for a specific PC network.

## Prerequisites
- Cisco Packet Tracer software installed.
- Basic understanding of IPv6 addressing and routing concepts.

## Topology Overview
- R1, R2, R3, and R4 routers are connected via their Gig 0/0/0 interfaces with the network prefix 2001:12:34::/64.
- Each router serves as a DHCPv6 server for a specific PC network.

## Configuration Steps

1. **IPv6 Interface Configuration**
   - Configure the Gig 0/0/0 interface on each router with an IPv6 address using the network prefix 2001:12:34::/64.

2. **Router Partial Configuration**
   - Configure R1, R2, R3, and R4 with partial settings to enable PC1 and PC2 to obtain IPv6 addresses, ping each other, and allow PC1 to ping the Gig 0/0/0 interfaces on R3 and R4.

3. **Enabling IPv6 Routing**
   - Ensure that IPv6 routing is enabled on all routers to allow packets to be routed between different PC networks.

4. **DHCPv6 Server Configuration**
   - Configure each router as a DHCPv6 server for its corresponding PC network. For example, configure R1 to serve PC1 network, R2 for PC2, and so on.
   - Set the DHCPv6 pool with the appropriate IPv6 address range, DNS server information, and other required settings.

5. **PC Configuration**
   - Configure each PC to use DHCPv6 for obtaining IPv6 settings.
   - PC1 should get settings from R1, PC2 from R2, and so on.

6. **Testing Connectivity**
   - Test connectivity between PCs within the same network.
   - Test connectivity between PCs in different networks.
   - Ensure PC1 can ping the Gig 0/0/0 interfaces on R3 and R4.

7. **Additional Configuration**
   - Configure additional settings on routers to allow all PCs to obtain correct IPv6 address settings and ping the Gig 0/0/1 interface on every other router.

## Note
- This guide provides a general outline. Specific commands and configurations may vary based on the Cisco IOS version and software.
- The provided network prefix (2001:12:34::/64) is a placeholder. You can replace it with your actual IPv6 network prefix.

## Conclusion
This read me file outlines the basic steps for configuring IPv6 routers and DHCPv6 servers for a network using Cisco Packet Tracer. It is recommended to understand the underlying concepts and adapt the instructions to your specific environment. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, refer to Cisco's official documentation or seek support from relevant forums or communities.
